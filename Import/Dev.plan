CORE
-Score
-Play volume coordinate space for enemy movement
-Boss fight framework
-Persistent GameInstance for storing lives, score, upgrade state, etc
-Lives, game over + continue, basic game flow
-Fix boost orientation being tied to the framerate
-Enemies that can stop the play volume until defeated
-Better notify player when enemy enters play volume

DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE
-Test Map
	-Multiple play volumes that the player can move between
	-Use for testing scenarios
-Sequence player blueprint w/time dilation support

NICE TO HAVE
-UMG-driven 3D minimap
-Itano missile movement by curve
-Score multiplier
-Combo system
	-Action readout
-Level streaming/transition framework with animated loading screen
-Twin missile impact point decals

FUTURE
-Powerup/upgrade system

FEEDBACK
Alex:
-Orientation is difficult
-Enemy awareness, should be in the level persistently rather than popping in
-Needs a progression system, too much to take in at once
